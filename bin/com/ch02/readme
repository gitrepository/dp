PATTERN: Observer Design pattern.

Define one-to-many dependency between the Objects so that when on Object changes state,
-all it's dependencies are notified and updated automatically.

If we have a need for publisher/Subscriber scenario, we use Observer Design Pattern.
Publisher here publishes (makes a change) and all the subscribers get notified 
-on the publication (on the change).
