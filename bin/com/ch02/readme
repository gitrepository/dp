Observer Pattern - Weather Station example
Implementing weather station example.
In this example, we will have to update different weather displays/observers (current, forecast, statistics)
-when there is a change in the weather data/subject.
Observer pattern is used to let the subject notify all it's observers up on change in the subject.

PATTERN: Observer Design pattern.

Define one-to-many dependency between the Objects so that when on Object changes state,
-all it's dependencies are notified and updated automatically.

If we have a need for publisher/Subscriber scenario, we use Observer Design Pattern.
Publisher here publishes (makes a change) and all the subscribers get notified 
-on the publication (on the change).
