SOLUTION #1: Overriding fly functionality in the sub class could solve the issue.
All the non flyable ducks will have this function do nothing.
ISSUE: Every duck that shouldn't fly should have this function overridden
-Any new duck (Wooden Decoy Duck) implementation should have the inherited functions changed accordingly.
Inheritance is NOT the solution.

PROBLEM: Inheritance gave Rubber duck the ability to fly.
As the super class (Duck) has been modified to have additional fly functionality,
-the rubber duck can now fly which shouldn't be the case.

RTB002:
com.ch01
Fly functionality to Duck. 
Now the generic Duck can fly as well.
Added fly functionality to it.

RTB001:
Simple Duck bird class implementation.
