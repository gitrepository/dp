FIX: Simple Factory defined. Encapsulate the varying part, that way any changes to the varying part
-is not directly effecting the class that uses it.

ISSUE: Different flavors of the same object. Things get complicated, need a better way to handle it.
Franchise the SimplePizzaFactory --> NYPizzaFactory, ChicagoPizzaFactory etc.
Each one makes cheese pizza differently. 
For instance, NYC likes it thin crust, Chicago deep dish thick crust.

CASE STUDY: Pizza franchise + making different type of pizzas.
In this case study we are going to look at different ways to 
-create objects (pizza types).

Simplest way: Pizza class having case conditional statement which will 
-generate the appropriate pizza. 

ISSUE: Upon addition/deletion of pizza types the code modification is needed.
DP-Code should be open for extension and closed for modification (is violated)
