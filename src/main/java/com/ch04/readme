CASE STUDY: Pizza franchise + making different type of pizzas.
In this case study we are going to look at different ways to 
-create objects (pizza types).

Simplest way: Pizza class having case conditional statement which will 
-generate the appropriate pizza. 

ISSUE: Upon addition/deletion of pizza types the code modification is needed.
DP-Code should be open for extension and closed for modification (is violated)
