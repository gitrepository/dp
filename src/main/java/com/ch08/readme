Simple Caffeine Beverage Example
FIX: TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN - it defines skeleton of an algorithm in a method (final), 
-deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template Method lets the subclass redefine certain steps of an algorithm 
-without changing it's structure/sequence.

ACaffeineBeverage (abstract class) template is defined where in the common steps are defined (final)
-and the more specific steps are redefined in the subclasses.

Simple Caffeine Beverage Example

We have two types of Caffeine Beverages, Tea & Coffee, whose preparation process is very similar
-except for few steps in the process.
There are few steps in the algorithm that are specific to Tea/Coffee, common steps being duplicated.

ISSUE: Duplication of common steps.
