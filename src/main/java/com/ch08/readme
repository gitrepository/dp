PATTERN: TEMPLATE METHOD - real world example (Array sorting)
Array sort is implemented by "compareTo" which varies based on the implementation.
CompareTo step in the sorting algorithm is implemented by the subclass (array object).

DP - Don't call us(High-level comp), we will call you(Low-level comp).

COMPARISON: Dependency Inversion -Vs- Hollywood Principle
Dependency Inversion principle is a technique of using Abstraction rather concrete classes.
Hollywood Principle is a technique for building components so that low-level components can be hooked
-into high-level components for computation without creating dependency between them.

COMPARISON: Template Method -Vs- Strategy
Template Method Pattern - Subclass decide how to implement steps in an algorithm.
- Algorithm implementation through inheritance.

Strategy Pattern - Encapsulate varying behavior and use delegation to decide which behavior to use.
- Algorithm implementation through composition.

Simple Caffeine Beverage Example
TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN with hook. At times hooks provide more flexibility. 
We use an abstract method if it is needed by the subclass to implement that step as a part of the algorithm.
We use hook if a method is optional (depending on the state) part of the algorithm.

Simple Caffeine Beverage Example
FIX: TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN - it defines skeleton of an algorithm in a method (final), 
-deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template Method lets the subclass redefine certain steps of an algorithm 
-without changing it's structure/sequence.

ACaffeineBeverage (abstract class) template is defined where in the common steps are defined (final)
-and the more specific steps are redefined in the subclasses.

Simple Caffeine Beverage Example

We have two types of Caffeine Beverages, Tea & Coffee, whose preparation process is very similar
-except for few steps in the process.
There are few steps in the algorithm that are specific to Tea/Coffee, common steps being duplicated.

ISSUE: Duplication of common steps.
