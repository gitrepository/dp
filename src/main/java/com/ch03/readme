ISSUE: Starbuzz added lot of different coffee types. Class explosion.
As each class coffee class was computing it's cost, each different coffee type
-had it's own class to compute the cost.
Maintenance nightmare, if cost of products (milk, powder, etc..) change, 
-would cause the code to change across all the classes.

CASE STUDY: Implement Starbuzz billing system.
Each type of coffee (DarkRoast, Decaf etc) have a discription &
-cost associated with it.
