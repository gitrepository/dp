COMMAND PATTERN: - Simple Remote Control implementation
Command Pattern encapsulates Request as an Object, thereby letting you parameterize 
-other objects with different requests/queues/log requests and support undoable operations.

Command pattern packages the actions and receiver up into an  object that exposes just one method, 
-execute().

Command Object encapsulates a request by binding together a set of actions on a specific receiver.

Simple remote Control implementation. This remote control has just one button.
Depending on the command that is being set to the RC slot, the corresponding action associated with the receiver 
-is being executed. Thus the RC is decoupled from the receiver.
The command object encapsulates action and ties it with the receiver.
