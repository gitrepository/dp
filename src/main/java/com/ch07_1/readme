DP - Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends.
This principle prevents us from creating designs that have a large number of classes
-coupled together.

DP guidelines
1. Invoke methods on the object
2. Invoke methods on objects passed in as method parameters
3. Invoke methods on objects that were created/instantiated in the class/method
4. Invoke methods on any components of the object
