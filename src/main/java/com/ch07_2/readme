FIX: FACADE PATTERN - Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in subsystem.
Facade defines a high level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

In case of a movie theater example, Facade provides a high-level interface (IHomeTheater).
For a client (user of the system), the home theater facade is an easy way to interact with the subsystem
Facade internally deals with subsystem interfaces thus making the sub system easier to use.

Facade pattern doesn't restrict the client from directly calling the subsystem interfaces.

Decorator Pattern	: Doesn't alter the behavior of the interface but add additional responsibility.
Adaptor Pattern		: Converts one interface to another that the client expects.
Facade Pattern		: Makes an interface simpler.

To watch a movie, the user has to deal with lots of sub system interfaces 
-as depicted in the picture.

ISSUE: Simple task (watch a movie) results in dealing with a lot of subsystem interfaces.
