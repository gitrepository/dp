Identify the aspects of the application that vary and separate them.
Take parts that vary and encapsulate them so that later you can extend or 
-alter them without affecting those that don't

Program to an interface and not to an implementation.
The above principle gives the client 
-flexibility at runtime to change the behavior of the class being referenced (polymorphism). 
Also decouples client from the actual implementation as the client is not aware of the 
-always deals with the interface. Provides loose coupling and gives more flexibility.

###-###
Favor Composition (HAS A) over Inheritance(extends).
Composition gives the scope for runtime modification of the composed reference provided
-it follows proper interface implementation.

When class inherit behavior by sub classing, this behavior is set statically  at compile time.
-In addition all sub class must inherit the same behavior.
When class extends behavior by composition, this behavior can be set dynamically at runtime.

Strive for loosely coupled designs between the objects that interact.
Loose coupling ==> less dependency ==> more flexibility

Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
